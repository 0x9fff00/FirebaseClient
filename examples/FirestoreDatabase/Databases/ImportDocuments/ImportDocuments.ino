/**
 * APP INITIALIZATION
 * ==================
 *
 * This library provides the APIs covers the different types of authentication and services.
 *
 * The FirebaseApp class was introduced as user authentication provider which provides the credentials data
 * used for accessing the Firebase services.
 *
 * The Database, Firestore, Functions, Messaging, Storage and Cloud Storage apps provided the functions based on
 * the specific Firebase services which take the auth credentials data from FirebaseApp.
 *
 * The FirebaseApp should be initialized first before use via static function initializeApp.
 *
 * SYNTAXES:
 *
 * initializeApp(<AsyncClient>, <FirebaseApp>, <user_auth_data>);
 *
 * The AsyncClient stores the user, server and network data which can be initialized as.
 *
 * WiFiClientSecure ssl_client;
 * DefaultNetwork network;
 * AsyncClient aClient(ssl_client, getNetwork(network));
 *
 * The FirebaseApp manage and stores the authentication data;
 *
 * The user_auth_data store the user credentials which can be obtained from one of following Auth classes.
 * UserAuth, ServiceAuth, CustomAuth, IDToken, AccessToken, CustomToken, LegacyToken and NoAuth via static function getAuth.
 *
 * SYNTAX:
 *
 * ServiceAuth service_auth(<TimeStatusCallback>, <api_key>, <client_email>, <project_id>, <private_key>, <expire>);
 *
 * <TimeStatusCallback> - The time status callback that provide the UNIX timestamp value used for JWT token signing.
 * <client_email> - The service account client Email.
 * <project_id> - The service account project ID.
 * <private_key> - The service account private key.
 * <expire> - The expiry period in seconds (less than or equal to 3600).
 *
 * The default network (built-in WiFi) configuration was used by default when
 * it was not assign to the function.
 *
 * To use other network interfaces, network data from one of the following Network classes
 * can be assigned.
 *
 * DefaultNetwork, GenericNetwork, EthernetNetwork and GSMNetwork.
 *
 * The network data (network_config_data) can be obtained from these Network classes via static function getNetwork.
 *
 * Please see examples/App/NetworkInterfaces for the usage guidelines.
 *
 * The auth data can be set to Services App e.g. Database to initialize via function getApp.
 *
 * SYNTAX:
 *
 * app.getApp<T>(<services_app>);
 *
 * Deallocation of FirebaseApp causes these services apps uninitialized and cannot be used.
 *

/**
 * IMPORT DOCUMENTS FUNCTIONS
 * ==========================
 *
 * SYNTAXES:
 *
 * Databases.importDocuments(<AsyncClient>, <Firestore::Parent>, <collectionIds>, <bucketID>, <storagePath>);
 * Databases.importDocuments(<AsyncClient>, <Firestore::Parent>, <collectionIds>, <bucketID>, <storagePath>, <AsyncResult>);
 * Databases.importDocuments(<AsyncClient>, <Firestore::Parent>, <collectionIds>, <bucketID>, <storagePath>, <AsyncResultCallback>, <uid>);
 *
 * The <Firestore::Parent> is the Firestore::Parent object included project Id and database Id in its constructor.
 * The Firebase project Id should be only the name without the firebaseio.com.
 * The Firestore database id should be (default) or empty "".
 *
 * The <collectionIds> is the collection ids to import.
 * Unspecified means all collections included in the import.
 * Use comma (,) to separate between the collection ids.
 *
 * The <bucketID> is the Firebase storage bucket ID in the project.
 * The <storagePath> is the path in the Firebase Storage data bucket that stores the exported database.
 *
 * The Databases is Firestore::Databases object that provide the main working functions.
 *
 * The async functions required AsyncResult or AsyncResultCallback function that keeping the result.
 *
 * The uid is user specified UID of async result (optional) which used as async task identifier.
 *
 * The uid can later get from AsyncResult object of AsyncResultCallback function via aResult.uid().
 *
 */

/**
 * ASYNC QUEUE
 * ===========
 *
 * Each sync and async requests data consume memory up to 1k. When many async operations are added to queue (FIFO), the memory usage was increased.
 *
 * Each AsyncClient handles this queue separately. Then in order to limit the memory used for each AsyncClient,
 * this library allows 10 async operations (called slots) can be stored in the queue at a time.
 * 
 * The maximum queue size can be set via the build flag FIREBASE_ASYNC_QUEUE_LIMIT or macro in
 * src/Config.h or created your own config in src/UserConfig.h.
 *
 * If the authentication async operation was required, it will insert to the first slot of the queue.
 *
 * If the sync operation was called, it will insert to the first slot in the queue too but after the authentication task slot.
 *
 * When async Get operation in SSE mode (HTTP Streaming) was currently stored in queue, the new sync and async operations will be inserted before
 * the async SSE (HTTP Streaming) slot.
 *
 * When the async operation queue is full, the new sync and async operations will be cancelled.
 *
 * The finished and time out operating slot will be removed from the queue unless the async SSE and allow the vacant slot for the new async operation.
 *
 * The async SSE operation will run continuously and repeatedly as long as the FirebaseApp and the services app
 * (Database, Firestore, Messaging, Functions, Storage and CloudStorage) objects was run in the loop via app.loop() or database.loop().
 *
 * STOP QUEUE
 * ===========
 *
 * SYNTAX:
 *
 * The async operation will be cancelled and remove from the queue by calling thes functions.
 *
 * asyncClient.stopAsync() - stop the last async operation in the queue.
 *
 * asyncClient.stopAsync(true) - stop all async operation in the queue.
 *
 * asyncClient.stopAsync("xxxx") - stop the async operation in the queue that has the async result UID xxxx.
 *
 * ASYNC CLIENT
 * ============
 *
 * The async client stores the async operating data in its queue and holds the pointer of SSL Client that assigned with it.
 *
 * The SSL Client should be existed in the AsyncClient usage scope in case of sync or should defined as global object for async usage.
 *
 * The SSL Client should not be shared among various AsyncClients because of interferences in async operations.
 *
 * Only one SSL Client should be assigned to or used with only one AsyncClient.
 *
 * SSL Client can force to stop by user or calling stop() from asyncClient.
 *
 * SYNTAX:
 *
 * asyncClient.stop() - stop the SSL Client to terminate the server connection.
 *
 *
 * THE STATIC ASYNC RESULT REQUIRED FOR ASYNC OPERATION
 * ====================================================
 *
 * Library provided the class object called AsyncResult that keeps the server response data, debug and error information.
 *
 * There are two sources of async result in this library:
 *
 * 1. From user provided with async application (function).
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * `Database.get(aClient, "/test/int", options, aResult);`
 *
 * 2. From dynamic allocation in the async client.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * `Database.get(aClient, "/test/int", options, asyncCB);`
 *
 * From source 1, the async result (`aResult`) shall be defined globally to use in async application because of the static data is needed for use while running the sync task.
 *
 * From source 2, the async client (`aClient`) shall be defined globally to use in async application too to make sure the instance of async result was existed or valid while running the sync task.
 *
 * If async result was destroyed (destructed or not existed) before it was used by async task handler, the danglig pointer problem will be occurred.
 *
 * Note that, the async client object used in authentication task shoul be defined globally as it is async task.
