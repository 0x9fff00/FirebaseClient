/**
 * APP INITIALIZATION
 * ==================
 *
 * This library provides the APIs covers the different types of authentication and services.
 *
 * The FirebaseApp class was introduced as user authentication provider which provides the credentials data
 * used for accessing the Firebase services.
 *
 * The Database, Firestore, Functions, Messaging, Storage and Cloud Storage apps provided the functions based on
 * the specific Firebase services which take the auth credentials data from FirebaseApp.
 *
 * The FirebaseApp should be initialized first before use via static function initializeApp.
 *
 * SYNTAXES:
 *
 * initializeApp(<AsyncClient>, <FirebaseApp>, <user_auth_data>);
 *
 * The AsyncClient stores the user, server and network data which can be initialized as.
 *
 * WiFiClientSecure ssl_client;
 * DefaultNetwork network;
 * AsyncClient aClient(ssl_client, getNetwork(network));
 *
 * The FirebaseApp manage and stores the authentication data;
 *
 * The user_auth_data store the user credentials which can be obtained from one of following Auth classes.
 * UserAuth, ServiceAuth, CustomAuth, IDToken, AccessToken, CustomToken, LegacyToken and NoAuth via static function getAuth.
 *
 * SYNTAX:
 *
 * LegacyToken legacy_token(<database_secret>);
 *
 * <database_secret> - The Realtime Database secret.
 *
 * To use other network interfaces, network data from one of the following Network classes
 * can be assigned.
 *
 * DefaultNetwork, GenericNetwork, EthernetNetwork and GSMNetwork.
 *
 * The network data (network_config_data) can be obtained from these Network classes via static function getNetwork.
 *
 * Please see examples/App/NetworkInterfaces for the usage guidelines.
 *
 * The auth credential data can be set to Services App e.g. Database to initialize via function getApp.
 *
 * SYNTAX:
 *
 * app.getApp<T>(<services_app>);
 *
 * Deallocation of FirebaseApp causes these services apps uninitialized and cannot be used.
 *
 * ASYNC QUEUE
 * ===========
 *
 * Each sync and async requests data consume memory up to 1k. When many async operations are added to queue (FIFO), the memory usage was increased.
 *
 * Each AsyncClient handles this queue separately. Then in order to limit the memory used for each AsyncClient,
 * this library allows 3-5 async operations (called slots) can be stored in the queue at the same time.
 *
 * If the authentication async operation was required, it will insert to the first slot of the queue.
 *
 * If the sync operation was called, it will insert to the first slot in the queue too but after the authentication task slot.
 *
 * When async Get operation in SSE mode (HTTP Streaming) was currently stored in queue, the new sync and async operations will be inserted before
 * the async SSE (HTTP Streaming) slot.
 *
 * When the async operation queue is full, the new sync and async operations will be cancelled.
 * 
 * The finished and time out operating slot will be removed from the queue unless the async SSE and allow the vacant slot for the new async operation.
 * 
 * The async SSE operation will run continuously and repeatedly as long as the FirebaseApp and the services app 
 * (Database, Firestore, Messaging, Functions, Storage and CloudStorage) objects was run in the loop via app.loop() or database.loop().
 * 
 * STOP QUEUE
 * ===========
 * 
 * SYNTAX:
 * 
 * The async operation will be cancelled and remove from the queue by calling thes functions.
 * 
 * asyncClient.stopAsync() - stop the last async operation in the queue.
 * 
 * asyncClient.stopAsync(true) - stop all async operation in the queue.
 * 
 * asyncClient.stopAsync("xxxx") - stop the async operation in the queue that has the async result UID xxxx.
 * 
 * ASYNC CLIENT
 * ============
 * 
 * The async client stores the async operating data in its queue and holds the pointer of SSL Client that assigned with it.
 * 
 * The SSL Client should be existed in the AsyncClient usage scope in case of sync or should defined as global object for async usage.
 * 
 * The SSL Client should not be shared among various AsyncClients because of interferences in async operations.
 *
 * Only one SSL Client should be assigned to or used with only one AsyncClient.
 * 
 * SSL Client can force to stop by user or calling stop() from asyncClient.
 * 
 * SYNTAX:
 * 
 * asyncClient.stop() - stop the SSL Client to terminate the server connection.
 *
